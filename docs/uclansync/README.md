description: UltimateClans addon to synchronize clans data across multiple servers
---

Welcome to UClanSync wiki, here you find information about the use of this addon.

## Introduction

By default Ultimate Clans doesn't have good compatibility with servers that have the same database for clans, so UClanSync provides an easy way to tell other servers when a clan needs to be updated via messaging system like Proxy, Plugin, Redis or RabbitMQ.

## Features

UClanSync contains a variety of features to use with data synchronization:

*  Compatibility with Redis and RabbitMQ.
*  Compatibility with clan homes, chat and chest into a cross-server instance.
